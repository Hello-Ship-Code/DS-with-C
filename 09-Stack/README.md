# Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. In a stack, the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. It supports two primary operations:

- **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removes the topmost element from the stack.

## **Applications:**

1. **Function Call Management:**
   - Manages function calls and local variables during recursive function execution.
   - Example: Call stack in programming languages.

2. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - Evaluates and converts expressions like infix to postfix or prefix.
   - Example: Expression parsers in compilers.

3. **Backtracking Algorithms:**
   - Supports algorithms that require exploring all possible options (e.g., depth-first search).
   - Example: Solving mazes, searching tree structures.

4. **Undo Mechanisms:**
   - Manages undo actions in text editors and software.
   - Example: Undo feature in text processing applications.

5. **Parenthesis Matching:**
   - Validates balanced parentheses in mathematical and programming expressions.
   - Example: Syntax checking in compilers and interpreters.

6. **Browser History Management:**
   - Maintains navigation history in web browsers, allowing the back and forward navigation.
   - Example: Back button functionality in web browsers.

7. **Memory Management:**
   - Manages memory allocation and de-allocation in runtime environments.
   - Example: Stack memory in process execution.

8. **Syntax Parsing:**
   - Assists in parsing and interpreting structured data or code.
   - Example: Parsing HTML or XML documents.
